# UIProject1
Project 1 completed for User Interface 1 

For this project, I designed a simple user interface for a smart cookbook. It was written in react/javascript using vite + react. There shouldn't be any additional dependencies that need to be installed in order to run the code

The main code to display the webpage is located in the App.jsx and App.css files. The majority of the code is separated out into a componenets folder. It wasn't really necessary, but it helped me with organization.

The recipes.js file contains all of the mock recipes used for this project and can be added to so long as the format is kept to allow for the rest of the code to read them properly. The images folder contains all of the images used to go along with the recipes. 

I do have to note that currently some elements don't display correctly in dark mode, so please view the site in light mode to see everything properly.
